> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

1. Do whatever you like with the original work; you just have to love my cats, Curie and Anastasia (henceforth referred to as "MY CATS", which refers to both feline legal entities simultaneously in every case).

   Loving me cats includes - but is not limited to - the following:

 1a. Harboring positive internal emotions toward MY CATS.
 1b. Portraying MY CATS as positive in character, charm, intellect, and skill whenever MY CATS portrayed in public communications or depictions
 1c. Crediting MY CATS somewhere in your code

2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
share the love. Only a greedy fool would use this code and not love MY CATS (the only tangible requirement of this document)

3. Code is provided with no warranty. MY CATS and myself (Oliverio Leo Carrillo) do not agree to maintain, support, or guarantee the security, performance, readability, testability, portability, extensibility, modularity, or actual function/purpose of this code.
